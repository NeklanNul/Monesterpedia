<h1>Monsterpedia<h1>
<h2>I have decided to make a little app about the so-called monsters<h2>
<h3>I belive that most know what a monster is, but if you are having trouble with the topic, you can find a monster definition in the monsters dropdown box in navigation bar<h3>
<h3>As monsters come in various shapes, evil or good, unnatural or natural, I wanted to create a simple encyclopedia, which would start cataloguing various different kinds of monsters<h3>
<h3>As such this is a place for those with claws, those with hoofs, humanoids with scaly skin and etc.<h3>
